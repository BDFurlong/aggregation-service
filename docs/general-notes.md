## General Notes

### Privacy Budget Enforcement

Aggregation Service enforces the
[no-duplicate](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#no-duplicates-rule)
rule. We recommend users design their systems keeping the no-duplicate rule in consideration. We
suggest reading the [debugging](/docs/debugging.md) document for debug aggregation runs.
